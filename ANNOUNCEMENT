  littler - Provides hash-bang (#!) capability for R (www.r-project.org)


Why ?
=====

  GNU R, a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics,
  provides a wonderful system for 'programming with data' as well as 
  interactive exploratory analysis, often involving graphs.

  Sometimes, however, simple scripts are desired. While GNU R can be used
  in batch mode, and while so-called 'here' documents can be crafted, a
  long-standing need for a scripting front-end has often been expressed 
  by the R Community.

  Littler (pronounce 'little R' and written 'r') aims to fill this need.  

  It can be used directly on the command-line just like, say, bc(1):


		$ echo 'cat(pi^2,"\n")' | r -p
		9.869604

  Equivalently, commands that are to be evaluated can be given on the
  command-line

		$ r -e 'cat(pi^2, "\n")'
		9.869604

  But unlike bc(1), GNU R has a vast number of statistical function. For
  example, we can quickly compute a summary() and a Tukey fivenum() for
  the file size in a given directory via

		$ ls -l /bin | awk '!/^total/ {print $5}' | 	\
		     r -e 'fsizes <- as.integer(readLines()); 	\
				  print(summary(fsizes)); 	\
				  cat("Fivenum\n"); 		\
				  print(fivenum(fsizes))'

		   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.
		      2    2926   13900   36140   35650  676400
		Fivenum
		[1]      2.0   2652.5  13896.0  35944.0 676384.0

  And, last but not least, this (somewhat unwieldy) expression can stored
  in a helper script:

		$ ls -l /bin | awk '!/^total/ {print $5}' | examples/fsizes.r
		   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.
		      2    2926   13900   36140   35650  676400
		Fivenum
		[1]      2.0   2652.5  13896.0  35944.0 676384.0
		$ cat examples/fsizes.r
		#!/usr/bin/env r

		fsizes <- as.integer(readLines())
		print(summary(fsizes))
		cat("Fivenum\n")
		print(fivenum(fsizes))

  (where calling /usr/bin/env is a trick from Python which allows one to
  forget whether r is installed in /usr/bin/r, /usr/local/bin/r, ~/bin/r, ...)
 

Where ?
=======

  Littler can either be downloaded from 

	  http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/LittleR

  accessed via SVN from

	  http://littler.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ littler

  or (soon !) be gotten from Debian mirrors via 

	  $ agt-get install littler
