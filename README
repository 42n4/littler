  I     Installation 
  ==================

  Linux and OS X builds are supported.  Please see the file 'INSTALL'
  for installation tips.


  II.   Implementation
  ====================

  littler is a C-language program named r that embeds GNU R (see "Embedding
  R under Unix-alikes" in the "Writing R Extensions" manual from either
  http://www.r-project.org/, or your R installations / sources) to
  provide the UNIX hashbang mechanism and simpler command-line support, 
  allowing users to create R scripts and popular "one-liners" using the 
  command-line flag --eval.  To do this, littler hard-codes certain bits 
  of R's installation and environment. The first R program in the user's 
  path, found during configuration, is used to glean those bits.


  II.1 R_HOME
  -----------

  The R_HOME environment variable is written to the header file littler.h
  so that it can be hard-coded into the r binary. Note that it overrides
  the user's own R_HOME environment variable when r is executed.


  II.2 R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES
  -----------------------

  To decrease r's startup time, it sets the environment variable
  R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES to NULL and then autoloads all of the default package
  methods. This is done by inspecting the R user option 'defaultPackages'
  and emitting c code to be statically compiled into r. See autoloads.R
  for more info.


  II.3 LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  --------------------

  To eliminate the dependency on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
  variable, at least on linux, r looks to the file R_HOME/etc/ldpaths
  to set the -rpath linker option  (see ldpaths.R for more
  info). Unfortunately this linker flag is not supported on Mac
  OS X, so r still depends on DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.

  One caveat of working directly with LD_LIBRARY_PATH is that if one ever 
  alters or updates R_HOME/etc/ldpaths (e.g. by running 'R CMD javareconf'),
  this will not be reflected in r. Thus, a re-compilation of r is necessary.

  II.4 Last but not least
  -----------------------

  Upon exit no cleanup is done and .Last() is not run. This behavior is
  more suitable for a scripting environment as opposed to an interactive
  one.


  III.  (In-) Frequently asked questions
  ======================================

  III.1  Why the name 'littler' ?
  ------------------------------

  We wanted something short, sweet and with sufficient reference to R
  without trampling over R. The 'little' part implies two things: 1)
  that the program name is the lower case 'r', and 2) that 'r' provides
  something less than GNU R, mainly the language interpreter without the
  R environment. 'littler' is meant to run in an automated, i.e scripted,
  fashion with little interaction from the user.

  We also like 'r' in /usr/local/bin/r, /usr/bin/r or on the command-line
  as it saves keystrokes, and does not harm the Shift key as much.

  Lastly, you will find a little r in both Jeffrey and Dirk.


  III.2. Wasn't there once a 'rinterp' as well ?
  ---------------------------------------------
 
  There was, but we think littler is cuter. See the previous question.


  III.3  I run a script trough 'littler' but nothing shows. What's up? 
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

  Add the --verbose flag. This will print out many relevant expressions,
  similar to GNU R. However, it won't print the value of expressions
  like for loops, if/else, or expressions within function calls. In
  that case you probably need to wrap a print() or cat() around what
  you want to show.


  III.4  Data sets are lost!
  -------------------------

  Actually, they aren't. But because 'littler' optimises the startup,
  they are never loaded. Just add
      library(datasets)
  to your script.


  III.5  It doesn't build and complains about 'R_SignalHandlers undeclared'
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  You need to upgrade to R 2.3.1 or newer. 

  Our configure ought to check for a minimal R versions and currently does
  not.


  III.6  The r binary name clashes with my R binary.
  --------------------------------------------

  Use the configure flag --program-prefix or --program-suffix to transform
  the binary name. For instance, if you would like the binary name to be
  'rsp' run configure like this:

      ./configure --program-suffix=sp

  and if you'd rather have a prefix to the binary, run:

      ./configure --program-prefix=little

  which will name the binary 'littler'. The binary, as well as the manual page,
  are renamed when 'make install' is run.  Should you need it, 'make uninstall'
  will also remember this setting.
