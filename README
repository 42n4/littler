  I     Installation 
  ==================

  Linux and OS X builds are supported.  Please see the file 'INSTALL'
  for installation tips.


  II.   (In-) Frequently asked questions
  ======================================

  II.1  Why the name 'littler' ?
  ------------------------------

  We wanted something short, sweet and with sufficient reference to R
  without trampling over R. The 'little' part implies two things: 1)
  that the program name is the lower case 'r', and 2) that 'r' provides
  something less that GNU R, mainly the language interpreter without the
  R environment. 'littler' is meant to run in an automated, i.e scripted,
  fashion with little interaction from the user.

  We also like 'r' in /usr/local/bin/r, /usr/bin/r or on the command-line
  as it saves keystrokes, and does not harm the Shift key as much.

  Lastly, you will find a little r in both Jeffrey and Dirk.


  II.2. Wasn't there once a 'rinterp' as well ?
  ---------------------------------------------
 
  There was, but we think littler is cuter. See the previous questions.


  II.3  I run a script trough 'littler' but nothing shows. What's up? 
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

  Add the --verbose flag. This will print out many relevant expressions,
  similar to GNU R. However, it won't print the value of expressions
  like for loops, if/else, or expressions within function calls. In
  that case you probably need to wrap a print() or cat() around what
  you want to show.


  II.4  Data sets are lost!
  -------------------------

  Actually, they aren't. But because 'littler' optimises the startup,
  they are never loaded. Just add
      library(datasets)
  to your script.


  II.5  It doesn't build and complains about 'R_SignalHandlers undeclared'
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  You need to upgrade to R 2.3.1 or newer. 

  Our configure ought to check for a minimal R versions and currentlyu does
  not.


  II.6  The r binary clashed with my R binary.
  --------------------------------------------

  Yes, we didn't do enough testing on OS X. That is an oversight we intend 
  to fix somewhow.  OS X will probably have to get a distinct binary name.
