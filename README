  I     Installation 
  ==================

  Linux and OS X builds are supported.  Please see the file 'INSTALL'
  for installation tips.

  II.   Implementation
  ====================

  littler is a c program named r that embeds GNU R (see "Embedding
  R under Unix-alikes" in the "Writing R Extensions" manual from
  http://www.r-project.org/) to provide the UNIX hashbang mechanism and
  simpler command-line support, allowiing users to creat R scripts and
  popular "one-liners" using the command line flag --eval.  To do this,
  littler hard-codes certain bits of R's installation and environment.
  The first R program in the user's path, found during configuration,
  is used the glean those bits.

  Bit one

  The R_HOME environment variable is written to the header file littler.h
  so that it can be hard-coded into the r binary. Note that it overrides
  the user's own R_HOME envrionment variable when r is executed.

  Bit two

  To decrease r's startup time, it sets the environment variable
  R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES to NULL and then autoloads all of the default package
  methods. This is done by inspecting the R user option 'defaultPackages'
  and emitting c code to be statically compiled into r. See autoloads.R
  for more info.

  Bit three

  To eliminate the dependency on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
  variable, at least on linux, r looks to the file R_HOME/etc/ldpaths
  to set the -rpath linker option  (see ldpaths.R for more
  info). Unfortunately this linker flag is not supported on Mac
  OS X, so r still depends on DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.

  One caveat of Bit three is that if one runs R CMD javareconf to update
  R_HOME/etc/ldpaths, this will not be reflected in r. Thus, a re-compilation
  is necessary

  Also, upon exit no cleanup is done and .Last() is not run.

  III.  (In-) Frequently asked questions
  ======================================

  III.1  Why the name 'littler' ?
  ------------------------------

  We wanted something short, sweet and with sufficient reference to R
  without trampling over R. The 'little' part implies two things: 1)
  that the program name is the lower case 'r', and 2) that 'r' provides
  something less than GNU R, mainly the language interpreter without the
  R environment. 'littler' is meant to run in an automated, i.e scripted,
  fashion with little interaction from the user.

  We also like 'r' in /usr/local/bin/r, /usr/bin/r or on the command-line
  as it saves keystrokes, and does not harm the Shift key as much.

  Lastly, you will find a little r in both Jeffrey and Dirk.


  III.2. Wasn't there once a 'rinterp' as well ?
  ---------------------------------------------
 
  There was, but we think littler is cuter. See the previous questions.


  III.3  I run a script trough 'littler' but nothing shows. What's up? 
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

  Add the --verbose flag. This will print out many relevant expressions,
  similar to GNU R. However, it won't print the value of expressions
  like for loops, if/else, or expressions within function calls. In
  that case you probably need to wrap a print() or cat() around what
  you want to show.


  III.4  Data sets are lost!
  -------------------------

  Actually, they aren't. But because 'littler' optimises the startup,
  they are never loaded. Just add
      library(datasets)
  to your script.


  III.5  It doesn't build and complains about 'R_SignalHandlers undeclared'
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  You need to upgrade to R 2.3.1 or newer. 

  Our configure ought to check for a minimal R versions and currently does
  not.


  III.6  The r binary clashed with my R binary.
  --------------------------------------------

  Yes, we didn't do enough testing on OS X. That is an oversight we intend 
  to fix somewhow.  OS X will probably have to get a distinct binary name.
