  I     Installation 
  ==================

  Linux and OS X builds are supported.  Please see the file 'INSTALL'
  for installation tips.


  II.   (In-) Frequently asked questions
  ======================================

  II.1  Why the name 'littler' ?
  ------------------------------

  We think it's cute. We wanted something short, sweet and with sufficient
  references to R without trampling over R.  

  We also like 'r' in /usr/local/bin/r, /usr/bin/r or on the command-line
  as it saves keystrokes, and does not harm the Shift key as much.


  II.2  I run a script trough littler but nothing shows. What's up? 
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

  Add the --verbose flag. This will print out many relevant expressions,
  similar to GNU R. However, it won't print the value of expressions
  like for loops, if/else, or expressions within function calls. In
  that case you probably need to wrap a print() or cat() around what
  you want to show.


  II.3  Data sets are lost!
  -------------------------

  Actually, they aren't. But because littler optimises the startup,
  they are never loaded. Just add
      library(datasets)
  to your script.
