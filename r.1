.SH NAME
r \- Provides hash-bang (#!) capability for R (www.r-project.org)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B r
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIfile
.br
.B r
[\fIoptions\fR] \fI-
.SH DESCRIPTION
Launches GNU R to execute the specified file containing R commands, or takes
commands from stdin if '-' is used to denote stdin, using the specified
options. This makes it suitable to create R scripts via the so\-called
shebang '#!/' line.

.SH USAGE
\fBr\fR can be used in command-line 'pipes' as well as in 'shebang'-style
scripts. 
.SH NOTE
The executable program is called 
\fBr\fR,
but the project is called
\fBlittler\fR
to avoid confusion with the real
\fBGNU R\fR.
.SH SEE ALSO
The 
\fBGNU R\fR
language is documented extensively at the R website
(http://www.r-project.org) and in several
manuals available in html, info and pdf.
