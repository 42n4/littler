Minimal recipes for installation:

$ ./configure

This will find the first path to R in your environment variable PATH. If
there's another path to R you want to use, then you'll have to readjust
PATH.

$ make
$ make install

This will build and install the 'r' binary, its manual page and the info
documentation.
