1. Installation from distributed sources
========================================

1.1 Requirements
----------------

    GNU R has to be installed in a shared-library configuration. This is the
    default. If in doubt, look for a file 'libR.so' which should be in the 
    lib/ directory of your R installtions, i.e. in
	/usr/local/lib/R/libR.so
    or
	/usr/lib/R/libR.so

    If R is not compiled with a shared library, you need to rebuild and 
    reinstall R.  

    This requirement also precludes installation of littler on Windoze.


1.2 Basic Steps
---------------

   The minimal recipe for installation should apply, i.e. start by

 	$ ./configure

   which will find the first path to R in your environment variable PATH. If
   there's another path to R you want to use, then you'll have to readjust
   PATH.

   Then

	$ make

   should build the 'r' binary, and 

	$ sudo make install

   should install it, as well as the manual page.




2. Installation from SVN
========================


2.1 Requirements
----------------

    As above, but you will also need autoconf, aclocal, and of course svn itself.


2.2 SVN checkout
----------------

    Anonymous checkout is available via 

	$ svn checkout http://littler.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ littler


2.3 Build preparation
---------------------

    You typically need to rebuild configure via

	$ aclocal && autconf 

    after which Step 1.2 applies: './configure && make && make install'.



3. Binary Installation
======================

3.1 Debian
----------

    Real Soon Now, we expect to be able to do

	$ sudo apt-get install littler

    but we're not quite there yet.
