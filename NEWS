Changes in 0.0.4

    *) Bug fix: forgot to reset membuf_t.buf after a call to resize_membuf()

    *) After R init, we delete R_SESSION_TMPDIR and point it to
       one of TMPDIR, TMP, TEMP, or "/tmp". We also turn off R's
       signal handlers.

Changes in 0.0.3

    *) Added Dirk's patch to configure.in to automatically find R in search
       path and to use --rpath linker option.

    *) Read commands from stdin when no file is given on command
       line. (feature request from Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>)

Changes in 0.0.2

    *) Added argv support. (feature request from 
       Juha Vierine <jvierine@gmail.com>)
